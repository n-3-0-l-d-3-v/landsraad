# LANDSRAAD — THE COLONY

> A 3-node replicated, consensus-driven distributed store with no shared memory or global clock.

## Why "LANDSRAAD"

The governing council of every Great House in the Imperium — independent, mutually distrustful parties who nonetheless have to reach binding collective decisions. That is distributed consensus described politically instead of technically: many nodes, no shared trust, still forced to agree.

Part of **[ARRAKIS](https://github.com/n-3-0-l-d-3-v/arrakis)** — a constrained computing
ecosystem built by removing assumptions ordinary computers depend on. This
repository is developed standalone and mirrored into the combined ecosystem
repo commit-for-commit.

## Status

**Phase 7 — QUEUED**

See [tickets/](tickets/) for the live phase-by-phase ticket board and
[docs/design/](docs/design/) for constraints, invariants and architecture
decision records.

## The constraint

Nodes communicate only over distrans, storage is still append-only, there is no global clock, and any node may crash at any time.

## What the constraint forces

Leader election, log replication, quorum commitment, and recovery that never silently produces an invalid committed state.

## Research question

> How does consensus behave when storage is immutable, messages are unordered/lossy, and wall-clock time is unavailable?

## Development

This is a real, tested, benchmarked systems component — not a demo. See
[docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md](docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md) for the acceptance
bar every piece of this repo must clear before it is considered complete.

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo bench
```
